# UVM RISC-V Register File Verification

This project demonstrates two verification approaches for a **RISC-V register file** using the **UVM (Universal Verification Methodology)** framework.  
The register file has **two write ports** and **three read ports**, and the verification focuses on validating its functionality.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Project Versions
The project contains two separate versions of the same testbench:

1. **RAL (Register Abstraction Layer) Based Verification**  
   - Uses UVM RAL model for register access and checking.  
   - Provides abstraction for register operations.  

2. **Reference Model Based Verification**  
   - Uses a custom reference model of the register file for result checking.  
   - Allows direct comparison of DUT outputs against the expected model behavior.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Contributions
- **My Work**  
  - Implemented **UVM RAL model** for the register file.  
  - Developed **Reference Model** for functional checking.  

- **Other Components** (developed by teammates)  
  - UVM environment (agents, drivers, monitors, scoreboard, etc.)  
  - Test scenarios and sequences.

## ðŸ”¹ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/uvm-riscv-regfile-verification.git
   cd uvm-riscv-regfile-verification
2. Compile and run simulations with your preferred simulator (Questa, VCS, Xcelium, etc.).

Example (Questa):
vlog -f filelist.f
vsim -c top_tb -do run.do


Example Output
